First repository for HW30 due Mon 11/11
I watched the Ravens beat the Bengals 49-13 today. That was good.

Big change for HW31 due Wed 11/13
The Ravens play the Houston Texans this Sunday at 1pm in Baltimore. Both the Ravens, 7-2, and the Houstons, 6-3, are division leaders. This game will have major implications for playoff standings come January.
